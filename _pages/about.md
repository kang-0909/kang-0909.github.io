<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a second-year PhD student in the [MŒº Lab](https://mulabpku.com/) at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Peking University, advised by Prof. [Muhan Zhang](https://muhanzhang.github.io/). My research centers on large language models, with a focus on strengthening their reasoning abilities and creativity‚Äîultimately enabling them to propose and solve innovative problems that may surpass human capabilities. Before graduate school, I received my bachelor‚Äôs degree from National University of Defense Technology, where I worked with Prof. Tiejun Li and Dr. Yanqiang Sun.
